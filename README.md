# NT-Greek-Tools
Here are some New Testament Greek reference tools. They are formatted formatted for easy searching in your browser which will let you search without diacritics. The tables have been formatted so that the headings remain visible even when you scroll your browser.

Feel free to download them and use them yourself -- each page can easily be saved to your own computer by simply right-clicking it.
