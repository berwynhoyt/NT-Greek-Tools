# NT-Greek-Tools
Here are some New Testament Greek reference tools. They are formatted formatted for easy searching in your browser which will let you search without diacritics. The tables have been formatted so that the headings remain visible even when you scroll your browser.

Feel free to download them and use them yourself -- each page can easily be saved to your own computer by simply right-clicking it.

  - Bonus: [Strongs Hebrew concordance](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/berwynhoyt/NT-Greek-Tools/blob/main/Strongs-hebrew-english-dictionary - updated English.html) in one table
- [Black vocab list](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/berwynhoyt/NT-Greek-Tools/blob/main/Black_Vocab_list_by_chapter.html) - from Black's textbook* - all in one table
- [Black cheatsheet](https://berwynhoyt.github.io/NT-Greek-Tools/Black_cheatsheet.pdf) - a 2-sided succinct summary of the whole Greek grammar in the rough order of Black's textbook*, though a few items have been moved to fit the headings better.

*The last two are specifically formatted to match *Learn to Read New Testament Greek* 3rd Edition, by David Alan Black.
